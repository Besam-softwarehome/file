        <h2 class= "colors">Hi, Melody Musuku</h2>
        <p>It all started when you were talking to your friend on the phone. He happens to be my
             friend too, and he called me to talk to you. That moment changed everything. 
             The moment I heard your voice I felt so different my blood moved a bit faster. 
             Your voice is soft, smooth and hits a different nerve in me. I couldn't give my 
             attention to anything else but you.</p><br>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
        <h2 class= "colors">Growing A Connection</h2>
        <p>It’s crazy how life connects people in ways we never expect. I never imagined how much of an 
            impact you would have on me. But with 
            every conversation, something started growing, something real, something deep.  
             You made me feel comfortable in a way that’s rare. You saw beyond what I said and 
             understood the things I didn’t even know how to put into words. That’s something 
             special, something I don’t take for granted.  
             With you, I feel cared for in a way that’s both gentle and strong.
            </p><br>

        <div class="page">
        <h2 class= "colors">My 10/10</h2>
        <p> It’s in the way you laugh so contagiously, how you walk by dragging your feet which might
            be weird but I find it cute and the way you allow me to express my profound
            feelings towards you it's so amazing. Hearing your voice alone brings a kind of peace I
            didn’t even realize I needed.  
            It’s funny how someone can enter your life and, without even trying, make it better just
            by being who they are. You’ve become someone I genuinely
            care for, someone who makes me feel like home even through just words on a screen 
            or the voice on the other side of the line.❤️</p><br>

        <p class="me">Every conversation, every laugh, and every little moment with you has made my world brighter. 
             You’ve become the person I look forward to hearing from each and every day, the one who makes
              my heart race in the sweetest way.<br>
             I really like who I am with you. Today I confidently say I want you. <strong>You are one of
             the things I'm sure of. </strong>  
            So, today I want to set boundaries around you by asking this question wrapped in all
             the care, affection, and excitement I feel for you…<strong class="colors">Will you be my girl and I your
                 man each and every day?❤️</strong></p>
